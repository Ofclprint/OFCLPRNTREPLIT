# App Store Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ Mobile app configured with Capacitor
✅ Android platform ready
✅ iOS platform ready
✅ Mobile-optimized components created

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### 1. Build Your App for Production

First, create the production build:

```bash
# Build the web app
npm run build

# Sync with mobile platforms (this copies your built web app to native projects)
npx cap sync

# Open native development environments
npx cap open android  # For Android Studio
npx cap open ios      # For Xcode (macOS only)
```

### 2. Google Play Store (Android)

#### Requirements:
- **Cost**: $25 one-time registration fee
- **Account**: Google Play Console developer account
- **Tools**: Android Studio (free)

#### Steps:
1. **Open Android Studio**: Run `npx cap open android`
2. **Test the app**: Use Android emulator or real device
3. **Generate signed APK**:
   - In Android Studio: Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK
   - Create a keystore file (keep this safe!)
4. **Upload to Play Console**:
   - Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
   - Create new app listing
   - Upload your APK/AAB file
   - Fill in app details, screenshots, descriptions
5. **Submit for review**: Usually takes 1-3 days

#### Required Assets:
- App icon (512x512 PNG)
- Screenshots for different screen sizes
- Feature graphic (1024x500)
- App description and privacy policy

### 3. Apple App Store (iOS)

#### Requirements:
- **Cost**: $99/year Apple Developer Program
- **Hardware**: Mac computer with Xcode
- **Account**: Apple Developer account

#### Steps:
1. **Open Xcode**: Run `npx cap open ios` (macOS only)
2. **Configure signing**: Add your Apple Developer account
3. **Test the app**: Use iOS Simulator or real device
4. **Archive and upload**:
   - In Xcode: Product → Archive
   - Use Xcode Organizer to upload to App Store Connect
5. **App Store Connect**:
   - Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
   - Create new app listing
   - Add app details, screenshots, descriptions
6. **Submit for review**: Usually takes 1-7 days

#### Required Assets:
- App icon (1024x1024 PNG)
- Screenshots for iPhone and iPad
- App description and keywords
- Privacy policy URL

### 4. Alternative: Progressive Web App (PWA)

If you want to skip app stores initially:

```bash
# Add PWA capabilities
npm install vite-plugin-pwa workbox-window
```

Users can install directly from your website on mobile devices.

### 5. Backend Deployment

Your app needs a live backend. Options:

#### Option A: Keep using Replit
- Deploy your current Replit project
- Use the live URL in your mobile app

#### Option B: Deploy elsewhere
- **Railway**: Easy deployment for Node.js apps
- **Render**: Free tier available
- **Vercel + PlanetScale**: Frontend + database
- **AWS/Google Cloud**: More control, higher cost

### 6. Mobile App Configuration

Update your `capacitor.config.ts`:

```typescript
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.yourcompany.manufacturingerp',
  appName: 'Manufacturing ERP',
  webDir: 'dist/public',
  server: {
    // Point to your live backend
    url: 'https://your-deployed-backend.com',
    cleartext: true
  }
};
```

### 7. Testing Before Submission

#### Android Testing:
```bash
# Build and test on device
npx cap run android

# Generate test APK
npx cap build android
```

#### iOS Testing:
```bash
# Build and test on device
npx cap run ios

# Test on simulator
npx cap run ios --target simulator
```
